This post covers how I provide WAN access to services that are hosted on my server.  On my server. I use `nginx` as a reverse proxy to forward WAN requests to a specific service to the appropriate server application. My `nginx` configuration will be the topic of another post. I use `x.domain.name` for my different services' addresses where `x` is an easy to remember identifier for the service.  

I registered a domain at [namecheap](https://namecheap.com) for a $35 annual fee. Instead of using Namecheap's DNS servers/nameservers (Namecheap BasicDNS or Namecheap Web Hosting DNS), I use Cloudflare's nameservers. These can be found on the DNS page after adding a site to your Cloudflare account, and can be subsequently added as "Custom DNS" nameservers in Namecheap's domain settings.

For each service, I added an `A` type DNS record in Cloudflare 's DNS page.  This requires entering the server's WAN/ISP provided IP, which may change periodically. To keep Cloudflare's DNS records consistent with the current WAN IP, I use the Dynamic DNS service on my pfSense router.  This service natively supports CloudFlare and each service can be added as a client as shown below.

Finally, requests to the default http (80) and https (443) ports to my WAN IP have to be forwarded to my server, specifically to the running `nginx` reverse proxy that is listening on these ports for http and https requests. The port forward rule for http is shown below. Repeat for https.
